# Linux Mint Landing Page (React/Tailwind)

I created the linux Mint official landing page using react, typescript and tailwind. 
This was a personal project to solidify my understanding of typescript and challenge myself to replicate the frontend as close as possible to the original.

Most assets (images, icons, etc.) used are from their official website at https://linuxmint.com/, everything else was created from the ground up.
