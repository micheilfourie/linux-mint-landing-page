## **Linux Mint Landing Page (React/TypeScript/Tailwind)**

This is a personal project where I recreated the official Linux Mint landing page using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

The goal was to deepen my understanding of TypeScript and challenge myself to replicate the frontend as closely as possible to the original design. Most visual assets (images, icons, etc.) were sourced from [linuxmint.com](https://linuxmint.com), but all layout, structure, and styling were built from scratch.

> ⚠️ **Note:** I developed only 6 pages for this project. Due to the larger-than-expected scope, several navigation links are non-functional.
