# Linux Mint Landing Page (React/Tailwind)

I created the linux Mint official landing page using react, typescript and tailwind. 
This was a personal project to solidify my understanding of typescript and challenge myself to replicate the frontend as close as possible to the original.

Most assets used are from their official website: https://linuxmint.com/.
